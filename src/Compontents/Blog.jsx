            <p className='article-text'>It is a long established fact that a reader will
              be distracted by the readable content of a
              page when looking at its layout. The point of
              using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-orless normal distribution of letters, as opposed
              to using 'Content here, content here', making
              it look like readable English. Many desktop
              publishing packages and web page editors
              now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model
              text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will
              uncover many web sites still in their infancy.
              Various versions have evolved over the years,
              sometimes by accident, sometimes on
              purpose (injected humour and the like).</p>
